- [**Prompts file**](./Prompts.md)  
  - Contains the prompts (*ísl. kveikjur* ✨) used to generate information, including keywords, chunks, summaries, and note-taking files.  
  - These prompts may require further refinement to fully generate the files in this repository, but they demonstrate their potential.


## Basic Usage

- (Optional) Use any MarkDown to pdf converter for documents to be printed.
- Review section lists and keywords to understand the main topics.
- Use the summaries to get a brief overview of each section.
- Use the note taking files to capture brief notes when doing initial review of each section

## Potential Learning Workflow

1. **Memorize Section Names**  
   Use a rote serial memorization technique to learn the section names in order through reinforcement:  
   - **Print the notes file**: This file includes a few empty lines for each section.  
   - **Initial thoughts**: Fill in the notes file with your initial thoughts on each section's subject. (These don’t need to be 100% accurate yet.) This step creates an associated memory for each section. As you try to recall the section in order, you’ll have context to link them to, resulting in a series of "AHA 💡!" moments for each section name you recall. Suggestions on how to do this can be found in step two.

2. **Explore the Section Content**
   - **Option A**:  
     - Read the summary file for each section.  
     - Condense the summary into your own words and jot it down on the notes file.  

   - **Option B**:  
     - Insert all the information for the book into a new ChatGPT project.  
     - Open a text/voice chat within the project and ask ChatGPT to review the section with you.  
     - Request brief summaries, clarifications, or questions about each section. (Again, this does not need to be 100% accurate at this stage.)  

3. **Dive Deeper into Each Section**
   - Once you start remembering the section names, apply the same process for individual sections:  
     - Use the chunks file and keywords file for context and details.  
     - Move from rote memorization of section names to memorizing the chunks and associating them with the keywords.  

4. **Master the Keywords and Context**
   - Memorize keyword definitions.  
   - Give the section a full read-through for a deeper understanding.  
   - Consider live tutoring for further clarification or interactive learning.
